The following are the characteristics of Glasss Catfish's appearance.

- The Glass Catfish has a completely see-through body, allowing you to see its bones, organs, and internal structures. This transparent appearance is due to the absence of pigments in its body.
- Because of its transparent nature, the Glass Catfish's skeleton and some internal organs, such as its digestive system, are easily visible.
- This catfish has a pair of long barbels on its upper lip.
- While it may initially appear that the Glass Catfish lacks a dorsal fin, a closer look reveals a small fin located behind its head.
- Unlike the rest of its body, the Glass Catfish's head is somewhat opaque and mostly white, distinguishing it from other members of its genus.

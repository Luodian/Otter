The following are the characteristics of Ryukin's appearance.

1. The Ryukin has a deep, tall body that is relatively compact, and it is the only goldfish breed whose body is taller than it is long. The body is very narrow, similar to a discus fish.
2. The Ryukin has a pointed, triangular head, which is more pronounced than in most goldfish breeds. It has a large hump that starts in the neck region and gives a more pointed appearance to the head.
3. The Ryukin's fins are similar to those of the Fantail goldfish, but it has a higher dorsal fin. The caudal fin is often twice as long as the body and may have three or four lobes. The Ryukin can be either short-finned or long-finned, with the latter being more sought-after for their flowing appearance.
4. Ryukins come in a variety of colors, including deep-red, red-and-white, white, silver, blue, black, orange, lavender grey, iron, and calico. The most common hues are solid reds and reds and whites

## üå≥ MIMIC-IT Overview

MIMIC-IT covers a vast array of real-life scenarios that empower Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to not only comprehend general scenes, but also to reason about context and astutely differentiate between observations. MIMIC-IT also enables the application of egocentric visual assistant model that can serve that can answer your questions like **Hey, Do you think I left my keys on the table?**. In addition to English, MIMIC-IT is also multilingual, supporting Chinese, Korean, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, and Arabic, thereby allowing a larger global audience to altogether enjoy from the convenience brought about by advancements in artificial intelligence.

High-quality instructions are essential for the zero-shot performance of large language models on interactive natural language tasks. For interactive vision-language tasks involving intricate visual scenes, a large quantity of diverse and creative instructions should be imperative to tune vision-language models (VLMs). Nevertheless, the current availability of vision-language instructions in terms of quantity, diversity, and creativity remains limited, posing challenges to the generalization of interactive VLMs. Here we present **MIMIC-IT**, a dataset comprising 2.8M multi-modal instructions-response pairs based on images and videos. Each instruction-response pair is accompanied by multi-modal in-context information, forming conversational contexts aimed at empowering VLMs in perception, reasoning, and planning. The instruction-response collection process, dubbed as $Syphus$, is scaled using an automatic annotation pipeline that combines human expertise with GPT's capabilities.

## Sythus Overview

<img src="docs/sythus.pdf"  width="80%" height="80%">

Sythus, an automated pipeline for generating high-quality instruction-response pairs in multiple languages. Building upon the framework proposed by LLaVA, we utilize ChatGPT to generate instruction-response pairs based on visual content. To ensure the quality of the generated instruction-response pairs, our pipeline incorporates system messages, visual annotations, and in-context examples as prompts for ChatGPT. System messages define the desired tone and style of the generated instruction-response pairs, while visual annotations provide essential image information such as bounding boxes and image descriptions. In-context examples assist ChatGPT in learning within the context.  During cold-start stage, in-context examples are collected by prompting ChatGPT solely through system messages and visual annotations, employing a heuristic approach. This stage concludes only when a satisfactory in-context examples are identified. In step 4, once the instruction-response pairs are obtained, the pipeline expands them into Chinese (zh), Japanese (ja), Spanish (es), German (de), French (fr), Korean (ko), and Arabic (ar).

## Sythus on your own dataset

We provide source code of the framework in [sythus](sythus) folder. You can use it to generate instruction-response pairs on your own dataset following the steps below.

1. Configure openai key. Create the following environment variables in your system.

``` bash
export OPENAI_API_TYPE="xxx"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://xxxx"
export OPENAI_API_VERSION="2023-03-15-xx"
export OPENAI_API_ENGINE="chatgpt0301"
```

1. Create a new file in `datasets` folder and name it as `your_dataset.py`.
2. Create a class named `YourDataset` in `your_dataset.py` and inherit from `abstract_dataset.AbstractDataset` class.
3. Implement `_load_query_inputs` methods in `YourDataset` class. This method should return a list of dict, each dict contains `id` and `sentences` keys.
4. `id` is the unique id of each query, `sentences` is a string for each query input.
5. You are done! Run the following command to generate instruction-response pairs on your own dataset.

``` bash
python  main.py --name YourDataset.your_dataset --num_threads 4
```

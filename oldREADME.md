[Blog post](https://laion.ai/blog/open-flamingo/) | Paper (coming soon)

Welcome to our open source version of DeepMind's [Flamingo](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/tackling-multiple-tasks-with-a-single-visual-language-model) model! In this repository, we provide a PyTorch implementation for training and evaluating OpenFlamingo models. We also provide an initial [OpenFlamingo 9B model](https://huggingface.co/openflamingo/OpenFlamingo-9B) trained on a new Multimodal C4 dataset (coming soon). Please refer to our blog post for more details.

This repo is still under development, and we hope to release better performing and larger OpenFlamingo models soon. If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue. We also welcome contributions!

# Installation

To install the package in an existing environment, run 
```
pip install open-flamingo
```

or to create a conda environment for running OpenFlamingo, run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Usage
We provide an initial [OpenFlamingo 9B model](https://huggingface.co/openflamingo/OpenFlamingo-9B) using a CLIP ViT-Large vision encoder and a LLaMA-7B language model. In general, we support any [CLIP vision encoder](https://huggingface.co/models?search=clip). For the language model, we support [LLaMA](https://huggingface.co/models?search=llama), [OPT](https://huggingface.co/models?search=opt), [GPT-Neo](https://huggingface.co/models?search=gpt-neo), [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/models?search=gptj), and [Pythia](https://huggingface.co/models?search=pythia) models.

#### NOTE: To use LLaMA models, you will need to install the latest version of transformers via
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```
Use this [script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py) for converting LLaMA weights to HuggingFace format.

## Initializing an OpenFlamingo model
``` python
from open_flamingo import create_model_and_transforms

model, image_processor, tokenizer = create_model_and_transforms(
    clip_vision_encoder_path="ViT-L-14",
    clip_vision_encoder_pretrained="openai",
    lang_encoder_path="<path to llama weights in HuggingFace format>",
    tokenizer_path="<path to llama tokenizer in HuggingFace format>",
    cross_attn_every_n_layers=4
)

# grab model checkpoint from huggingface hub
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import torch

checkpoint_path = hf_hub_download("openflamingo/OpenFlamingo-9B", "checkpoint.pt")
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(checkpoint_path), strict=False)
```

## Generating text
Here is an example of generating text conditioned on interleaved images/text, in this case we will do few-shot image captioning.

``` python
from PIL import Image
import requests

"""
Step 1: Load images
"""
demo_image_one = Image.open(
    requests.get(
        "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg", stream=True
    ).raw
)

demo_image_two = Image.open(
    requests.get(
        "http://images.cocodataset.org/test-stuff2017/000000028137.jpg",
        stream=True
    ).raw
)

query_image = Image.open(
    requests.get(
        "http://images.cocodataset.org/test-stuff2017/000000028352.jpg", 
        stream=True
    ).raw
)


"""
Step 2: Preprocessing images
Details: For OpenFlamingo, we expect the image to be a torch tensor of shape 
 batch_size x num_media x num_frames x channels x height x width. 
 In this case batch_size = 1, num_media = 3, num_frames = 1 
 (this will always be one expect for video which we don't support yet), 
 channels = 3, height = 224, width = 224.
"""
vision_x = [image_processor(demo_image_one).unsqueeze(0), image_processor(demo_image_two).unsqueeze(0), image_processor(query_image).unsqueeze(0)]
vision_x = torch.cat(vision_x, dim=0)
vision_x = vision_x.unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(0)

"""
Step 3: Preprocessing text
Details: In the text we expect an <image> special token to indicate where an image is.
 We also expect an <|endofchunk|> special token to indicate the end of the text 
 portion associated with an image.
"""
tokenizer.padding_side = "left" # For generation padding tokens should be on the left
lang_x = tokenizer(
    ["<image>An image of two cats.<|endofchunk|><image>An image of a bathroom sink.<|endofchunk|><image>An image of"],
    return_tensors="pt",
)


"""
Step 4: Generate text
"""
generated_text = model.generate(
    vision_x=vision_x,
    lang_x=lang_x["input_ids"],
    attention_mask=lang_x["attention_mask"],
    max_new_tokens=20,
    num_beams=3,
)

print("Generated text: ", tokenizer.decode(generated_text[0]))
```

# Approach
OpenFlamingo is a multimodal language model that can be used for a variety of tasks. It is trained on a large multimodal dataset (e.g. Multimodal C4) and can be used to generate text conditioned on interleaved images/text. For example, OpenFlamingo can be used to generate a caption for an image, or to generate a question given an image and a text passage. The benefit of this approach is that we are able to rapidly adapt to new tasks using in-context training.

## Model architecture
OpenFlamingo seeks to fuse a pretrained vision encoder and a language model using cross attention layers. The model architecture is shown below.

# Training
To train a model, modify the following example command, which uses OPT 1.3B as an example LM:
```
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 train.py \
--run_name flamingo3B \
--lm_path facebook/opt-1.3b \
--tokenizer_path facebook/opt-1.3b \
--dataset_resampled \
--laion_shards "/path/to/shards/shard-{0000..0999}.tar" \
--mmc4_shards "/path/to/shards/shard-{0000..0999}.tar" \
--batch_size_mmc4 4 \
--batch_size_laion 8 \
--train_num_samples_mmc4 125000 \
--train_num_samples_laion 250000 \
--loss_multiplier_laion 0.2 \
--workers=6 \
--num_epochs 250 \
--lr_scheduler constant \
--warmup_steps 5000 \
--use_media_placement_augmentation \
--mmc4_textsim_threshold 30
```

## Dataset
We expect all our training datasets to be [WebDataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset) shards.
We train our models on the [LAION 2B](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-en) and Multimodal C4 (coming soon) datasets. By default the LAION 2B dataset is in WebDataset format if it is downloaded using the [img2dataset tool](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) and Multimodal C4 comes packaged in the WebDataset format.


# Evaluation
We currently support running evaluations on [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home), [VQAv2](https://visualqa.org/index.html), [OKVQA](https://okvqa.allenai.org), [Flickr30k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset), and [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/index.php). Note that currently these evaluations are ran in validation mode (as specified in the Flamingo paper). We will be adding support for running evaluations in test mode in the future.

Before evaluating the model, you will need to install the coco evaluation package by running the following command:
```
pip install pycocoevalcap
```

To run evaluations on OKVQA you will need to run the following command:
```
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

To evaluate the model, run the script at `open_flamingo/scripts/run_eval.sh`

# Future plans
- [ ] Add support for video input
- [ ] Release better performing and larger OpenFlamingo models
- [ ] Expand our evaluation suite
- [ ] Add support for FSDP training

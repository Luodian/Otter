## ü¶¶ Overview

Recent research emphasizes the importance of instruction tuning in empowering Large Language Models (LLMs), such as boosting GPT-3 to Chat-GPT, to adhere to natural language instruction and effectively accomplish real-world tasks. Flamingo is considered a GPT-3 moment in the multimodal domain. 

In our project, we propose ü¶¶ Otter, an in-context instruction-tuned model built upon Flamingo. We enhance its chat abilities by utilizing a carefully constructed multimodal instruction tuning dataset. Each data sample includes an image-specific instruction along with multiple multimodal instructions, also referred to as multimodal in-context learning examples.

By leveraging these high-quality data, we train Otter with limited resources in our lab, and it achieves better performance than Flamingo. Although Otter may not be the smartest and sometimes gets confused, we are committed to continuously improving it. In this era of booming large-scale foundation models, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to train their own models, even with limited data and resources, and nurture the models to develop their own intelligence.

## ü¶¶ Examples

## üóÇÔ∏è Environments

You may install via `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Especially to make sure the `transformers>=4.28.0`, `accelerate>=0.18.0`.

## ü§ó Hugging Face Model

You can use the ü¶© Flamingo model / ü¶¶ Otter model as a ü§ó huggingface model with only a few lines! One-click and then model configs/weights are downloaded automatically. 

``` python
from flamingo import FlamingoModel
flamingo_model = FlamingoModel.from_pretrained("luodian/openflamingo-9b-hf", device_map=auto)

from otter import OtterModel
otter_model = OtterModel.from_pretrained("luodian/otter-9b-hf", device_map=auto)
```

Previous [OpenFlamingo](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo) was developed with [DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel) (DDP). Loading OpenFlamingo-9B to GPU requires **at least 33G GPU memory**, which is only available on A100 GPUs.

In order to allow more researchers without access to A100 machines to try training OpenFlamingo, we wrap the OpenFlamingo model into a ü§ó huggingface model ([Jinghao](https://king159.github.io/) has submited a [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/23063) to the /huggingface/transformers!). We use `accelerator` to speed up our training and implement it in a fully sharded mechanism (via `device_map=auto`) across multiple GPUs. 

This can help researchers who do not have access to A100-80G GPUs to achieve the similar throughput in training, testing on 4x RTX-3090-24G GPUs, and model deployment on 2x RTX-3090-24G GPUs. Specific details are below (may vary depending on the CPU and disk performance, as we conducted training on different machines).

Our Otter model is also developed in this way and it's deployed on the ü§ó Hugging Face model hub. Our model can be hosted on two RTX-3090-24G GPUs and achieve a similar speed to one A100-80G machine.

## üóÑ Dataset Preparation

### Multi-model instruction tuning dataset with in-context examples
The pre-training process for the OpenFlamingo model employs the MMC4 interleaved multimodality dataset to endow the model with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. The development of our instruction-following dataset adheres to the guiding principles of MMC4, which dictate that the instruction and image examples incorporated into the context should exhibit semantic pertinence to the query instruction and image.

1. To augment the LLAVA dataset, we retrieve in-context examples for each query data.
2. We curate high-quality video data from the Video PSG repository (https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenPSG). For each video, we select 4-8 frames to be annotated for instruction-following, using the LLAVA dataset as a reference. During the training phase, given a frame, we opt for additional frames, along with their corresponding instructions and answers, to serve as in-context examples.

### Preparation

We unify different instructing data into a single dataset [class](pipeline/multi_instruct_data_utils/unify_dataset.py). Full dataset is comming soon! 

<!-- Download a subset of the pretraining `multi_instruct_data` dataset

```bash
wget https://ofa-beijing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/datasets/pretrain_data/pretrain_data_examples.zip;
unzip pretrain_data_examples.zip ./example_multi_instruct_data
``` -->

## ‚òÑÔ∏è Training

Train on `multi_instruct` datasets, using the following commands:

First, run, and answer the questions asked. This will generate a config file and save it to the cache folder. The config will be used automatically to properly set the default options when doing `accelerate launch`.

```bash
accelerate config
```

Then run the training script.

```bash
accelerate launch --pretrained_model_name_or_path=luodian/openflamingo-9b-hf \
--lm_path=luodian/llama-7b-hf \
--tokenizer_path=luodian/llama-7b-hf \
--dataset_resampled \
--multi_instruct_path=./in_context_instruct.tsv \
--run_name=otter-9b \
--batch_size=1 \
--num_epochs=6 \
--report_to_wandb \
--cross_attn_every_n_layers=4 \
--lr_scheduler=cosine \
--delete_previous_checkpoint \
--learning_rate=1e-5 \
```

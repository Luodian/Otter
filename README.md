## ü¶¶ Why In-Context Instruction Tuning?

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional universal aptitude as few/zero-shot learners for numerous tasks, owing to their pre-training on extensive text data. Among these LLMs, GPT-3 stands out as a prominent model with significant capabilities. Additionally, variants of GPT-3, namely InstructGPT and ChatGPT, have proven effective in interpreting natural language instructions to perform complex real-world tasks, thanks to instruction tuning. 

Motivated by the upstream interleaved format pretraining of the Flamingo model, we present ü¶¶ Otter, a multi-modal model based on OpenFlamingo (the open-sourced version of DeepMind's Flamingo). We train our Otter in an in-context instruction tuning way on our proposed **MI**-**M**odal **I**n-**C**ontext **I**nstruction **T**uning (**MIMIC-IT**) dataset. Otter showcases improved instruction-following and in-context learning ability in both images and videos.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

MIMIC-IT enables the application of egocentric visual assistant model that can serve that can answer your questions like **Hey, Do you think I left my keys on the table?**. Harness the power of MIMIC-IT to unlock the full potential of your AI-driven visual assistant and elevate your interactive vision-language tasks to new heights.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RCGp0vQ1/syphus.png"  width="80%" height="80%">
</p>

We also introduce **Syphus**, an automated pipeline for generating high-quality instruction-response pairs in multiple languages. Building upon the framework proposed by LLaVA, we utilize ChatGPT to generate instruction-response pairs based on visual content. To ensure the quality of the generated instruction-response pairs, our pipeline incorporates system messages, visual annotations, and in-context examples as prompts for ChatGPT. 

For more details, please check the [MIMIC-IT dataset](mimic-it/README.md).


## ü§ñ Otter Model Details

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/CKgQ2PP7/otter-teaser.png"  width="100%" height="100%">
</div>

Otter is designed to support multi-modal in-context instruction tuning based on the OpenFlamingo model, which involves conditioning the language model on the corresponding media, such as an image that corresponds to a caption or an instruction-response pair.

We train Otter on MIMIC-IT dataset with approximately 2.8 million in-context instruction-response pairs, which are structured into a cohesive template to facilitate various tasks. Otter supports videos inputs (frames are arranged as original Flamingo's implementation) and multiple images inputs as in-context examples, which is **the first multi-modal instruction tuned model**. 

The following template encompasses images, user instructions, and model-generated responses, utilizing the `User` and `GPT` role labels to enable seamless user-assistant interactions.

```python
prompt = f"<image>User: {instruction} GPT:<answer> {response}<endofchunk>"
```

Training the Otter model on the MIMIC-IT dataset allows it to acquire different capacities, as demonstrated by the LA and SD tasks. Trained on the LA task, the model exhibits exceptional scene comprehension, reasoning abilities, and multi-round conversation capabilities. 

```python
# multi-round of conversation
prompt = f"<image>User: {first_instruction} GPT:<answer> {first_response}<endofchunk>User: {second_instruction} GPT:<answer>"
```

Regarding the concept of organizing visual-language in-context examples, we demonstrate here the acquired ability of the Otter model to follow inter-contextual instructions after training on the LA-T2T task. The organized input data format is as follows:

```python
# Multiple in-context example with similar instructions
prompt = f"<image>User:{ict_first_instruction} GPT: <answer>{ict_first_response}<|endofchunk|><image>User:{ict_second_instruction} GPT: <answer>{ict_second_response}<|endofchunk|><image>User:{query_instruction} GPT: <answer>"
```

For more details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05425)'s appendix for other tasks.
## üóÇÔ∏è Environments

1. Compare cuda version returned by nvidia-smi and nvcc --version. They need to match. Or at least, the version get by nvcc --version should be <= the version get by nvidia-smi.
2. Install the pytorch that matches your cuda version. (e.g. cuda 11.7 torch 2.0.0). We have successfully run this code on cuda 11.1 torch 1.10.1 and cuda 11.7 torch 2.0.0. You can refer to PyTorch's documentation, [Latest](https://pytorch.org/) or [Previous](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).
3. You may install via `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Especially to make sure the `transformers>=4.28.0`, `accelerate>=0.18.0`.

After configuring environment, you can use the ü¶© Flamingo model / ü¶¶ Otter model as a ü§ó Hugging Face model with only a few lines! One-click and then model configs/weights are downloaded automatically. Please refer to [Huggingface Otter/Flamingo](./docs/huggingface_compatible.md) for details.

## ‚òÑÔ∏è Training

Otter is trained based on OpenFlamingo. You may need to use converted weights at [luodian/OTTER-9B-INIT](https://huggingface.co/luodian/OTTER-9B-INIT) or [luodian/OTTER-MPT7B-Init](https://huggingface.co/luodian/OTTER-MPT7B-Init). They are respectively converted from [OpenFlamingo-LLaMA7B-v1](https://huggingface.co/openflamingo/OpenFlamingo-9B) and [OpenFlamingo-MPT7B-v2](https://huggingface.co/openflamingo/OpenFlamingo-9B-vitl-mpt7b), we added a `<answer>` token for Otter's downstream instruction tuning. 

You may also use any trained Otter weights to start with your training on top of ours, see them at [Otter Weights](https://huggingface.co/luodian). You can refer to [MIMIC-IT](https://github.com/Luodian/Otter/tree/main/mimic-it) for preparing image/instruction/train json files.

## 🦦 Overview

Recent research emphasizes the importance of instruction tuning in empowering Large Language Models (LLMs), such as boosting GPT-3 to Chat-GPT, to adhere to natural language instruction and effectively accomplish real-world tasks. Flamingo is considered a GPT-3 moment in the multimodal domain. In our project, we propose 🦦 Otter, an in-context instruction-tuned model built upon Flamingo. We enhance its chat abilities by utilizing a carefully constructed multimodal instruction tuning dataset. Each data sample includes an image-specific instruction along with multiple multimodal instructions, also referred to as multimodal in-context learning examples.

## 🗂️ Environment

You may install via `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Especially to make sure the `transformers>=4.28.0`, `accelerate==0.19.0.dev0`.

## 🤗 Hugging Face Model

Previous OpenFlamingo was developed with DDP and it's not easy to implement a fully sharded mechanism. Loading OpenFlamingo-9B to GPU memory requires >33G GPU memory.

To accelerate and demoncratize it, we wrap the Open Flamingo model into a 🤗 huggingface model. We use `accelerator` to speed up our training and implement in a fully sharded mechanism across multiple GPUs. 

This can help researchers who do not have access to A100-80G GPUs to achieve the same throughput in training, testing on 4x3090-24G GPUs and model deployment on 2x3090-24G GPUs. Specific details are in below.

Our Otter model is also developed in this way and it's deployed on the 🤗 Hugging Face model hub.

You can use the 🦩 Flamingo model / 🦦 Otter model as a huggingface model with only few lines! One click and then model configs/weights are downloaded automatically.

``` python
from flamingo import FlamingoModel
flamingo_model = FlamingoModel.from_pretrained("luodian/openflamingo-9b-hf")

from otter import OtterModel
otter_model = OtterModel.from_pretrained("luodian/otter-9b-hf")
```

## 🗄 Dataset Preparation

Download a subset of the pretraining `multi_instruct_data` dataset

```bash
wget https://ofa-beijing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/datasets/pretrain_data/pretrain_data_examples.zip;
unzip pretrain_data_examples.zip ./example_multi_instruct_data
```

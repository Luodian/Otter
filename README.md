## ü¶¶ Overview

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional universal aptitude as few/zero-shot learners for numerous tasks, thanks to their pre-training on large-scale text data. GPT-3 is a prominent LLM that has showcased significant capabilities in this regard. Furthermore, variants of GPT-3, namely InstrctGPT and ChatGPT, equipped with instruction tuning, have proven effective in interpreting natural language instructions to perform complex real-world tasks. In this paper, we propose to introduce instruction tuning into multi-modal models, motivated by the Flamingo model's upstream interleaved format pretraining dataset. We adopt a similar approach to construct our **MI**-**M**odal **I**n-**C**ontext **I**nstruction **T**uning (**MIMIC-IT**) dataset. We then introduce ü¶¶ Otter, a multi-modal model based on OpenFlamingo (open-sourced version of DeepMind's Flamingo), trained on MIMIC-IT and showcasing improved instruction-following ability and in-context learning. We also optimize OpenFlamingo's implementation for researchers, democratizing the required training resources from 1x A100 GPU to 4x RTX-3090 GPUs, and integrate both OpenFlamingo and Otter into Hugging Face Transformers for more researchers to incorporate the models into their customized training and inference pipelines.

## üóÇÔ∏è Environments

You may install via `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Especially to make sure the `transformers>=4.28.0`, `accelerate>=0.18.0`.

## ü§ó Hugging Face Model

You can use the ü¶© Flamingo model / ü¶¶ Otter model as a ü§ó Hugging Face model with only a few lines! One-click and then model configs/weights are downloaded automatically.

``` python
from flamingo import FlamingoModel
flamingo_model = FlamingoModel.from_pretrained("luodian/openflamingo-9b-hf", device_map=auto)

from otter import OtterModel
otter_model = OtterModel.from_pretrained("luodian/otter-9b-hf", device_map=auto)
```

Previous [OpenFlamingo](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo) was developed with [DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel) (DDP) on A100 cluster. Loading OpenFlamingo-9B to GPU requires **at least 33G GPU memory**, which is only available on A100 GPUs.

In order to allow more researchers without access to A100 machines to try training OpenFlamingo, we wrap the OpenFlamingo model into a ü§ó hugging Face model ([Jinghao](https://king159.github.io/) has submitted a [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/23063) to the /huggingface/transformers!). Via `device_map=auto`, the large model is sharded across multiple GPUs when loading and training. This can help researchers who do not have access to A100-80G GPUs to achieve similar throughput in training, testing on 4x RTX-3090-24G GPUs, and model deployment on 2x RTX-3090-24G GPUs. Specific details are below (may vary depending on the CPU and disk performance, as we conducted training on different machines).

</div>

Our Otter model is also developed in this way and it's deployed on the ü§ó Hugging Face model hub. Our model can be hosted on two RTX-3090-24G GPUs and achieve a similar speed to one A100-80G machine.



## üóÑ Dataset

Please refer to [MIMIC-IT](mimic-it/README.md) for more details.

## ‚òÑÔ∏è Training

Train on `MIMIC-IT` datasets, using the following commands:

First, run, and answer the questions asked. This will generate a config file and save it to the cache folder. The config will be used automatically to properly set the default options when doing `accelerate launch`.

```bash
accelerate config
```

Then run the training script.

```bash
accelerate launch --config_file=./accelerate_configs/accelerate_config_fsdp.yaml \
pipeline/train/instruction_following.py \
--pretrained_model_name_or_path=path/to/otter_9b_hf  \
--dataset_resampled \

--images_path="path/to/image.json" \
--train_config_path="/mnt/petrelfs/zhangyuanhan/data/LLaVA-Instruct-150K/DC/DC_train.json" \
--batch_size=4 \
--num_epochs=3 \
--report_to_wandb \
